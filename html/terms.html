			<h3>Rights You Grant Us</h3>
			<p>Our Service lets you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. You will retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. However you grant Populic Oy and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Service and researching and developing new ones.</p>
			<p>Because Live, Local, and any other crowd-sourced Services are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, in addition to granting us the rights mentioned in the previous paragraph, you also grant us a perpetual license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicense, publicly perform, and publicly display content submitted to the Service in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).
			</p>
			<p>To the extent it’s necessary, when you appear in, create, upload, post, or send Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced content, you also grant Populic Oy, our affiliates, and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation, reimbursement or other kind of indemnification from Populic Oy, our affiliates, or our business partners if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced Services, either on our application or on one of our business partner’s platforms.
			</p>
			<p>For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our Support Site.</p>
			<p>We may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time - even in situations where we are not legally obligated to do so - and for any reason, including but not limited to situations where we think your content violates these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service.</p>
			<p>The Service may contain advertisements. In consideration for Populic Oy letting you access and use the Service, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Service. Because the Service contains content that you and other users provide us, advertising may sometimes appear near your content.</p>
			<p>In situations where we receive feedback or suggestions from you, we will hold the right to use your ideas without compensating you.</p>

Therefore we do not take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Service.
			</p>
			<p>For the sake of clarity let it be stated that Populic Oy does not want the Service to be put to bad uses. But due to the fact that we do not review all content, we don't guarantee that content on the Service is always conforming to our Terms or Guidelines.

			<h3>Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver</h3>
			<p><b>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU AND POPULIC OY TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.</b>
			</p>
			<p>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You and Populic Oy agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Service that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Populic Oy are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. For the sake of clarity let it be stated that the phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms.</p>
			<p>Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, available here as of the date of these Terms, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
			<p>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</p>
			<p>Fees. If you choose to arbitrate with Populic Oy, you will not have to pay any fees to do so. That is because Populic Oy will reimburse you for your filing fee and the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules provide that any hearing fees and arbitrator compensation are our responsibility. To the extent another arbitral forum is selected, Populic Oy will pay that forum’s fees as well.</p>
			<p>Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Populic Oy. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Populic Oy.</p>
			<p>Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND POPULIC Oy WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Populic Oy are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Populic Oy over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND POPULIC OY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
			<p>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 17.</p>
			<p>Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.</p>
			<p>Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Populic Oy can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Populic Oy in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your username and the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: Populic Oy, ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out Betonimiehenkuja 3D Espoo Finland, or email the opt-out notice to populicoy@gmail.com.</p>
			<p>Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Populic Oy may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>
			<p>Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Populic Oy.</p>

			<h3>Exclusive Venue</h3>
			<p>To the extent that these Terms allow you or Populic Oy to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Populic Oy agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the Supreme Court of Finland. If, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the Los Angeles Superior Court.

			</p>
			<p>These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
			<p>If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.</p>
			<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you</p>
			<p>You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.</p>
